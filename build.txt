BUILDING

The following libraries are required to build Enso Retreat:

WTL 9.1 (http://wtl.sourceforge.net)
The Boost library (http://boost.org, boost 1.68 installed through NuGet will work)
Microsoft DirectX SDK 9 (http://msdn.microsoft.com/directx/)

Use global compiler define NODXSDK to build Angelic Retreat with WINMM library instead of 
DirectShow (DirectX SDK is not necessary in this case).
